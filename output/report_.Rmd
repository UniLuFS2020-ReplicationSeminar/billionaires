### Interduction

This report aims to answer the following research question:

Did countries with a higher proportion of billionaires have a higher GDP growth rate in the early 21th century?

```{r}
billionaires_data <- readRDS(here("data", "re_data.rds"))
```

## Hypothesis

We hypothesise that countries with a higher proportion of billionaires don't have a higher GDP growth rate in the early 21th century. And if they do, we suspect a causation instead of a causality.
