# Billionaires
A project by: Rakesh, Benjamin, Nils and Jan

# About the Project

This project is carried out as part of the Data Mining seminar. The aim is to answer the following research question:

Did countries with a higher proportion of billionaires have a higher GDP growth rate in the early 21th century?

This is only done superficially, a more detailed analysis would be valuable.

# Folder Structure
In our repo we got several different folders:
* data: for the raw data files
* data_prep: preprocessing data
* scripts: for our wip scripts
* output: for the plots and final report file
* junk: for files that we didnt want to delete just yet but arent used anymore
