A project by: Rakesh, Benjamin, Nils and Jan
# About the Project

This project is carried out as part of the Data Mining seminar. The aim is to answer the following research question:

Did countries with a higher proportion of billionaires have a higher GDP growth rate in the early 21th century?

This is only done superficially, a more detailed analysis would be valuable.
